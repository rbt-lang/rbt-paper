    We introduce Rabbit, a combinator-based query language.  Rabbit is designed
    to let data analysts and other accidental programmers query complex
    structured data.

    We combine the functional data model and the categorical semantics of
    computations to develop denotational semantics of database queries.  In
    Rabbit, a query is modeled as a Kleisli arrow for a monadic container
    determined by the query cardinality.  In this model, monadic composition
    can be used to navigate the database, while other \emph{query combinators}
    can aggregate, filter, sort and paginate data; construct compound data;
    connect self-referential data; and reorganize data with grouping and data
    cube operations.  A context-aware query model, with the input context
    represented as a como\-nadic container, can express query parameters and
    window functions.  Rabbit semantics enables pipeline notation, encouraging
    its users to construct database queries as a series of distinct steps, each
    individually crafted and tested.  We believe that Rabbit can serve as a
    practical tool for data analytics.
