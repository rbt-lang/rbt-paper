Rabbit is a combinator-based query language for categorical databases. It
proposes a formal query model using query combinators and has a working
prototype implemented in Julia. It shows how complex business inquiries can be
incrementally translated into auditable and succinct federated queries.

SEQUEL was an early attempt to address an "increasing need to bring the
non-professional user into effective communication with a formatted database"
(Chamberlin, D; Boyce, R, 1974).  We think Rabbit is a notable milestone in
this challenge.
