    We introduce Rabbit, a combinator-based query language.  Rabbit is designed
    for data analysts and other accidental programmers to let them query
    complex structured data.

    Rabbit features new query semantics, in which a query is represented as a
    function with certain input type, output type and cardinality.  Notably,
    query cardinality is modeled as a monadic structure over its output type,
    with monadic composition giving us ability to navigate the database.  Other
    \emph{query combinators} express operations for aggregating, filtering,
    grouping, sorting and paginating data, cube operations and operations on
    self-referential data.  By extending the query model with a comonadic
    structure over its input type, we can express queries with running
    aggregates and queries with parameters.  Rabbit semantics enables pipeline
    notation, encouraging its users to construct database queries as a series
    of distinct steps, each individually crafted and tested.  We believe that
    for data analytics, Rabbit presents a superior alternative to SQL.
