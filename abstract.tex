    We introduce Rabbit, a combinator-based database query language.  It is
    designed for data analysts and other accidental programmers to let them
    query complex structured data.

    Rabbit features a novel semantics of a database query and query
    composition.  A query is represented as a mapping with certain input type,
    output type and cardinality.  Notably, query cardinality is modeled as a
    monadic wrapper over its output type, which is what makes Rabbit queries
    highly composable and let it express common data operations as \emph{query
    combinators}.  In particular, monadic composition becomes a data traversal
    combinator.  Other combinators express operations for aggregating,
    filtering, grouping, sorting and paginating data, cube operations and
    operations on self-referential data.  By extending the query model with a
    comonadic wrapper over its input type, we can express queries with running
    aggregates and parametric queries.  Aside from semantics, Rabbit features
    pipeline syntax notation, which permits and stimulates the users to
    construct database queries as a series of distinct steps, each individually
    crafted and tested.  We believe that for data analytics, Rabbit presents a
    viable alternative to SQL.
