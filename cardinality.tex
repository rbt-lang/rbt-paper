\section{Query Cardinality}
\label{sec:cardinality}

In Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, we suggested that a database query could be
modeled as a function.  However, this na\"{\i}ve model failed to represent
optional and plural relationships as well as queries lacking apparent input.
In this section, we resolve these issues by introducing the notion of
\emph{query cardinality}.

We found it difficult to model these two relationships:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \label{itm:employee-to-manager}
\emph{An employee may have a manager.}

\item \label{itm:department-to-employee}
\emph{A department is staffed by a number of employees.}
\end{enumerate}

We were also puzzled on how to express input-free queries such as:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item \label{itm:department-set}
\emph{Show a list of all departments.}
\end{enumerate}

We could attempt to represent optional and plural output values as instances of
the container types
\begin{equation*}
    \Opt{A} \quad \text{and} \quad \Seq{A},
\end{equation*}
where the \emph{option} container $\Opt{A}$ holds zero or one value of type
$A$, and the \emph{sequence} container $\Seq{A}$ holds an ordered list of
values of type~$A$.  Using these containers,
relationships~\ref{itm:employee-to-manager}
and~\ref{itm:department-to-employee} could be expressed as primitive queries
with signatures
\begin{alignat*}{3}
    & \Manager && : \Emp && \to \Opt{\Emp}, \\
    & \Employee && : \Dept && \to \Seq{\Emp}.
\end{alignat*}
Moreover, we could guess the output of query~\ref{itm:department-set}.  Indeed,
\emph{a list of all departments} can only mean $\Seq{\Dept}$.

To describe the input of query~\ref{itm:department-set}, we use a
\emph{singleton} type
\begin{equation*}
    \Void.
\end{equation*}
The type $\Void$ has a unique inhabitant ($\top:\Void$), and because there is no
freedom in choosing a value of this type, it can designate input that can never
affect the result of a query.  Thus, we can express~\ref{itm:department-set} as
a \emph{class} primitive
\begin{equation*}
    \Department : \Void \to \Seq{\Dept}.
\end{equation*}

Unfortunately, although containers let us represent optional and plural output,
they do not compose well.  For example, it is tempting to express \emph{for a
given employee, find their manager's salary} as a composition
\begin{equation} \label{eq:manager-to-salary}
    \Manager\To\Salary, \tag{$\star$}
\end{equation}
or \emph{show the names of all departments} as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:department-to-name}
    \Department\To\Name. \tag{$\star\star$}
\end{equation}
However, if we look at the signatures of the components
\begin{alignat*}{6}
    & \Manager && : \Emp && \to \Opt{\Emp}, \quad && \Salary && : \Emp && \to \Int, \\
    & \Department && : \Void && \to \Seq{\Dept}, \quad && \Name && : \Dept && \to \Text,
\end{alignat*}
we see that their intermediate domains do not agree, which means their
compositions are ill-formed.

To make the queries compose again, we need to distinguish between the output
type of a query and its cardinality.  For example, we should say that
query~\ref{itm:employee-to-manager} is an optional query from $\Emp$ to $\Emp$,
\ref{itm:department-to-employee} is a plural query from $\Dept$ to $\Emp$, and
\ref{itm:department-set} is a plural query from $\Void$ to $\Dept$.  Then, any
two queries should compose, regardless of their cardinalities, so long as they
have compatible intermediate types; furthermore, the least upper bound of their
cardinalities is the cardinality of their composition.

Specifically, given two queries
\begin{equation*}
    p : A \to \Wrap{M_1}{B}, \qquad q : B \to \Wrap{M_2}{C}
\end{equation*}
we first promote their output to a common cardinality
\begin{equation*}
    M = M_1 \sqcup M_2,
\end{equation*}
and then use the \emph{monadic composition} combinator
\begin{equation*}
    \placeholder\,\To\,\placeholder : (A \to \Wrap{M}{B},\; B \to \Wrap{M}{C}) \to (A \to \Wrap{M}{C})
\end{equation*}
to construct their composition
\begin{equation*}
    p\,\To\,q : A \to \Wrap{M}{C}.
\end{equation*}
Using this rule, we can justify the queries (\ref{eq:manager-to-salary}) and
(\ref{eq:department-to-name}) and give them signatures
\begin{alignat*}{3}
    & \Manager\To\Salary && : \Emp && \to \Opt{\Int}, \\
    & \Department\To\Name && : \Void && \to \Seq{\Text}.
\end{alignat*}

Let us work out the details.  Query cardinalities are ordered with respect to
inclusions
\begin{equation*}
    A \sqsubseteq \Opt{A} \sqsubseteq \Seq{A},
\end{equation*}
which, using the notation for container instances
\begin{equation*}
    \bot,\; \optional{a} : \Opt{A}, \qquad [a_1,\ldots,a_n] : \Seq{A},
\end{equation*}
are defined by
\begin{alignat*}{5}
    & \; && \bot && : \Opt{A} && \longmapsto [\;] && : \Seq{A}, \\
    & a : A \longmapsto\ && \optional{a} && : \Opt{A} && \longmapsto [a] && : \Seq{A}.
\end{alignat*}
This order lets us, whenever nessesary, promote any query $A\to\Wrap{M}{B}$ to
a query $A\to\Wrap{M'}{B}$ with a greater cardinality $M' \sqsupseteq M$.

Monadic composition for the option and sequence containers is well known.  For
optional queries
\begin{equation*}
    p : A \to \Opt{B}, \qquad q : B \to \Opt{C},
\end{equation*}
it is defined by
\begin{align*}
    & p\,\To\,q : A \to \Opt{C}, \\
    & p\,\To\,q : a \mapsto \begin{cases}
        \optional{c} & (p(a)=\optional{\,b},\; q(b)=\optional{c}), \\
        \bot & (\text{otherwise}).
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
For plural queries
\begin{equation*}
    p : A \to \Seq{B}, \qquad q : B \to \Seq{C},
\end{equation*}
the sequence $(p\,\To\,q)(a)$ is calculated by applying $p$ to $a$
\begin{equation*}
    a \overset{p}{\longmapsto} [b_1, b_2, \ldots],
\end{equation*}
then applying $q$ to every element of $p(a)$
\begin{equation*}
    [b_1, b_2, \ldots]
    \overset{[q]}{\longmapsto}
    [[c^{1}_{1}, c^{2}_{1}, \ldots], [c^{1}_{2}, c^{2}_{2}, \ldots], \ldots],
\end{equation*}
and finally merging the nested sequences
\begin{equation*}
    [[c^{1}_{1}, c^{2}_{1}, \ldots], [c^{1}_{2}, c^{2}_{2}, \ldots], \ldots]
    \overset{\cancel{\,[\;]\,}}{\longmapsto}
    [c^{1}_{1}, c^{2}_{1}, \ldots, c^{1}_{2}, c^{2}_{2}, \ldots].
\end{equation*}

We are now ready to present the design of a combina\-tor-based query language.

\input{figure-folded-form}

\begin{description}
\item[Query model:]
A database query is characterized by its input type $A$, its output type $B$
and its cardinality $M$, and can be represented as a function of the form
\begin{equation*}
    p : A \to M\{B\},
\end{equation*}
where $M\{B\}$ is one of $B$, $\Opt{B}$ or $\Seq{B}$; the respective queries
are called singular, optional or plural.

\item[Primitives:]
The set of primitives includes classes
\begin{alignat*}{3}
    & \Department && : \Void && \to \Seq{\Dept}, \\
    & \Employee && : \Void && \to \Seq{\Emp},
\end{alignat*}
attributes
\begin{alignat*}{6}
    & \Name && : \Dept && \to \Text, \qquad
    && \Name && : \Emp && \to \Text, \\
    & \Position && : \Emp && \to \Text, \qquad
    && \Salary && : \Emp && \to \Int,
\end{alignat*}
and relationships
\begin{alignat*}{3}
    & \Department && : \Emp && \to \Dept, \\
    & \Employee && : \Dept && \to \Seq{\Emp}, \\
    & \Manager && : \Emp && \to \Opt{\Emp}, \\
    & \Subordinate && : \Emp && \to \Seq{\Emp}.
\end{alignat*}
Note that a name can be shared by multiple primitives as long as they have
different input types.

\item[Combinators:]
The composition combinator sends two queries
\begin{equation*}
    p : A \to M_1\{B\}, \qquad
    q : B \to M_2\{C\}
\end{equation*}
to their composition
\begin{equation*}
    p\,\To\,q : A \to M\{C\} \qquad (M = M_1 \sqcup M_2).
\end{equation*}

More combinators are described in the following sections.
\end{description}

\input{figure-unfolded-form}

Recall that we started with the schema graph in
Figure~\ref{fig:sample-schema}, which gave us the original, incomplete set of
primitives.  To reflect the remaining primitives, we should add the $\Void$
node and the missing arcs (see Figure~\ref{fig:folded-form}).
Furthermore, we will transform the schema graph into an (infinite) tree by
unfolding it starting from the $\Void$ node (see
Figure~\ref{fig:unfolded-form}).   The unfolded form could be seen as the
database schema realized in the hierarchical data\-base model.
